# YOUR PRODUCTION SERVER

In the last exercise, we successfully automated the deployment of a simple web
application to a Vagrant machine. In this exercise, we are going try it on a
real live server, accessible to everyone on the internet.

*Before tools like VirtualBox and Vagrant were the norm, it was commonplace to
provision servers on the internet for testing deployments. This was slow and
tediousâ€”as you have likely seen already, there is a __lot__ of trial and error
associated with this work. Also, we had to pay for every failed attempt!*

## EXERCISE

Now it is time to spin up a new (Ubuntu) server with that provider so we can
test our configuration in the wild.

Visit https://bocoup.signin.aws.amazon.com/console with the username and
password "eagleapps". Then, browse to the EC2 control panel and speak with
the facilitator on how to start an instance.

Use a playbook to deploy an application from the previous exercises.

You'll know you've been successful when your fellow attendees can see your
application in a browser via it's public IP address (e.g. http://52.5.119.57).

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- How do you provision a server with your cloud provider?
- How do you deploy your application to the server?
